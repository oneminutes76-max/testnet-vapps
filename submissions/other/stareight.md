## Project
# Fair Lottery on Chain 🎟️✨
## Overview
**Fair Lottery on Chain** is a simple decentralized lottery system that leverages the **Soundness Layer** to ensure fairness and verifiable randomness.  

Each round, a random winner is selected through *verifiable randomness proofs* generated by Soundness CLI. The process is fully transparent and tamper-proof, giving players confidence that results are fair.  

---

## Why Soundness Layer?
- **Fairness** → The lottery results cannot be manipulated, as they rely on verified randomness.  
- **Transparency** → Everyone can verify the proof of the winning draw.  
- **Trustless** → No need to trust a central authority — Soundness guarantees fairness.  

---

## Gameplay
1. Players buy a lottery ticket (on-chain entry).  
2. At the end of the round, Soundness CLI generates randomness to determine the winner.  
3. The winning ticket is verified through a proof.  
4. Rewards are distributed to the winner automatically.

## Example Use Cases
- **Community events** → Weekly prize draws for community engagement.  
- **Education** → A simple way to showcase verifiable randomness in action.  
- **On-chain rewards** → Winners could receive tokens or NFTs as prizes.
