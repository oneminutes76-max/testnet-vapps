  ## Summary  
This PR introduces **Proof-Based Rock Paper Scissors**, a decentralized version of the classic game, enhanced with the **Soundness Layer** to guarantee fairness.  

Players commit their move secretly, then reveal it with zero-knowledge proofs. The Soundness Layer ensures that no player can alter their choice after committing, making the game transparent, trustless, and tamper-proof.

## Key Features  
- **Commit/Reveal Fairness** → Players cannot change moves after seeing their opponent’s choice.  
- **Verifiable Gameplay** → Every match result is proof-verified on-chain.  
- **Trustless Rewards** → Wagers and payouts are handled by smart contracts, no referee needed.  
- **Future Expansion** → Leaderboards, tournaments, and NFT trophies.  

---

## Technical Overview  
- **Frontend**: React → Simple Rock Paper Scissors UI.  
- **Backend**: Node.js → Match coordination & player states.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity / Move → Wager lock, outcome validation, reward distribution.  
- **Proof System**: Soundness CLI → Commit & reveal proof generation/verification.  
- **Storage**: WALRUS/IPFS → Match history & leaderboard data.

## Timeline  
- **PoC (2-3 weeks)**: Commit & reveal proof system, single on-chain match demo.  
- **MVP (4-6 weeks)**: Token wagering, on-chain leaderboard, simple UI.  
- **Full Version (8+ weeks)**: Tournament mode, NFT trophies, advanced gameplay.
